# BeerSnob

## Description

App users can choose from a predefined list to learn about different beer styles and their characteristics.

## Installation

I still want to add some features to this app so it is not yet a gem, but will be in the future! For now, clone down the repo by entering `git clone https://github.com/meg-gutshall/beer_snob.git` into your terminal.

## Usage

To run BeerSnob, `cd` into the file where your clone is stored, then type `./bin/beer-snob` into the terminal to begin the app. It will prompt you to pick a family style and then a beer style from that family's list. Type `styles` to display the list of beer styles from the chosen family, type `families` to display the list of family styles, or type `exit` to quit the application.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
